# Transcription factor analysis

The aim of this code is to subset each transcription factor from your significant results and place the results of that into the folder TranscriptionFactors/

```{r}
TF <- read.csv("TF.csv", header = T)
TF <- TF %>% filter(X == "Yes") %>% select(Name)
```

```{r}
design_files <- list.files(path="results", pattern = "(design_)*res\\.csv$")

for (i in design_files) {
 df <- read.csv(paste0("results/",i), header=T)
 df_new <- subset(df, SYMBOL %in% toupper(TF$Name))
 dir.create(file.path("TranscriptionFactors"), showWarnings = FALSE)
 write.csv(df_new, file=paste0("TranscriptionFactors/",i))
  }

```
